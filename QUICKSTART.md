# ‚ö° Quick Start - 5 Minutes to TTS with REAL Pauses

## The Problem This Solves

**Most TTS systems CANNOT do precise pauses!**
- SSML `<break>` tags are often ignored
- Natural pauses are ~0.15s and unpredictable
- You can't hit exact timings for audio/video sync

**This tool gives you EXACT pause control:** 0.5s, 2.3s, 10s, 60s - whatever you need!

## For Users Cloning This Repo

### 1. Clone & Setup (2 minutes)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Kokoro-TTS-Pause.git
cd Kokoro-TTS-Pause
bash setup.sh
```

Wait for setup to complete (~2 min for dependencies + model download).

### 2. Test It Works (30 seconds)
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
bash examples/quick_test.sh
```

You should see: `‚úÖ Test successful! Audio file created: test_output.wav`

### 3. Generate Your First Audio (2 minutes)
